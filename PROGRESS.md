### Test Summary

**Total Tests**: 26
**Passing**: 26
**Failing**: 0
**Coverage**: Core modules at 95%+

#### Test Breakdown by Module

| Module | Tests | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| `test_file_model.py` | 7 | ✅ All passing |
| `test_formats.py` | 10 | ✅ All passing |
| `test_scanner.py` | 9 | ✅ All passing |

- Formats tested: JPG, PNG, GIF
- Nested directory structure for recursive scan testing
- Non-image files for filtering verification

### Known Limitations (Phase 1)

1. **UI Freezing During Scan**
   - Scanning is synchronous and blocks the GUI thread

3. **HEIC Support**
   - `pillow-heif` library installed but not extensively tested
   - May need additional system dependencies on some platforms
   - **Addressed in Phase 4**: Full HEIC integration and testing

4. **No GUI Tests**
   - Only unit tests for core modules
   - Manual testing required for GUI functionality
   - **Addressed in Phase 2**: pytest-qt automated GUI tests
